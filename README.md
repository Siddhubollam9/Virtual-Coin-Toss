# README - Virtual Coin Toss

## Project Overview
The **Virtual Coin Toss** is a simple Python program that simulates flipping a coin. It allows users to perform multiple coin tosses, track results, and view statistics. The project is designed to strengthen fundamental Python skills, including randomization, loops, and user interaction.

## Features
- ✅ Simulates a random coin toss (**Heads/Tails**)
- ✅ Allows users to flip the coin multiple times
- ✅ Tracks and displays the count & percentage of results
- ✅ Interactive user input for restarting or exiting
- ✅ **Bonus:** GUI mode using Tkinter for a graphical experience

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI mode)

## How to Run
### 1. Run in Console Mode:
```sh
python coin_toss.py
```
- Enter the number of flips when prompted.
- View results and decide whether to play again.

### 2. Run in GUI Mode:
- Choose "yes" when prompted at the start.
- Click the "Toss Coin" button to simulate a flip.
- View results and statistics in real-time.

## Learning Outcomes
- Using the `random` module for randomization
- Handling loops & counters for tracking results
- Managing user input in an interactive way
- Implementing a simple graphical UI with Tkinter (Bonus)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Store session history
- Add graphical coin flip animation
- Introduce different coin designs
